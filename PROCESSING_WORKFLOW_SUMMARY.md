# Processing Workflow Summary (March 30, 2025)

## Current Status
- Current progress: 33.94% (428/1261 chunks processed)
- Target: 66.0% (requires 404 more chunks)
- Last checkpoint: Chunk ID 7105, Document ID unknown
- Processing rate: ~0.22 chunks/second (when running)
- Estimated completion time: ~61 minutes (if processor runs continuously)

## Resource Constraints
- System is experiencing persistent termination of processor and monitor processes
- Memory usage: ~167.5MB with vector store loaded, ~160.7MB in deep sleep mode
- CPU usage: ~41.5%, Memory: ~84.0% (contributing to terminations)
- Database experiencing occasional connection issues

## Created Solutions
1. **Enhanced Monitor System**
   - Script: `enhanced_monitor.sh`
   - Features: More frequent checks (15s), improved restart logic, better error handling
   - Status: Working but still terminates unexpectedly

2. **Ultra-Conservative Processing Approach**
   - Script: `processors/single_chunk_processor.py`
   - Script: `ultra_conservative_scheduler.sh`
   - Features: Process one chunk at a time with complete exit and restart
   - Status: Created but not yet tested

3. **Super Monitor**
   - Script: `super_monitor_process.sh`
   - Features: Monitor both processor and monitor processes, handle restarts
   - Status: Created but not yet tested

## Next Steps
1. Check current progress using: `python check_adaptive_processor.py`
2. Try the ultra-conservative approach:
   ```bash
   # Fix any remaining issues with the single-chunk processor
   python processors/single_chunk_processor.py
   
   # Or use the scheduler for continuous processing
   ./ultra_conservative_scheduler.sh
   ```
3. If that doesn't work, try increasing cooldown periods or other resource conservation strategies

## Files to Track
- `logs/checkpoints/adaptive_processor_checkpoint.pkl` - Contains processing progress
- `logs/processor_66_percent_*.log` - Latest processor logs
- `logs/scheduler.log` - Ultra-conservative scheduler logs
- `logs/super_monitor.log` - Super monitor logs

## Strategy Notes
- Conservative processing with longer cooldown periods may be necessary due to severe resource constraints
- Focus on stable, incremental progress rather than speed
- Consider implementing a "time of day" processing schedule if necessary
